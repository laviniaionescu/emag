This is a school project led by our teacher that demonstrates a web application built with Flask. The app includes a user login feature and retrieves product data from a PostgreSQL database. 
It utilizes a configuration file to connect to the database and displays products in a user-friendly format, while featuring user login functionality, database connection to retrieve product data, and displays product information on the home page.
It was built using Flask, PostgresSQL and html/css.
